                "Eliza and George Harris are married before the start of the book, with a child, Harry, being under the care of Eliza. Eliza and George are under different owners, with George being rightfully angry that his owner stripped him of a factory job where he was accomplishing much. Eliza learns that her son, Harry, will be sold to Mr. Haley (and Uncle Tom, which will be covered separately) and opts to run away instead of face separation. Separately, George Harris also opts to run and try to buy freedom for his wife, not knowing that she had already escaped. Eliza Runs across the ice on the Ohio River to meet with Senator Byrd, and what would be a very ironic scene ensures as the senator, just having championed the fugitive slave law, is forced to reckon with his own actions. The senator eventually helps Eliza to find her way to a Quaker settlement, as Eliza reunites with her husband, George Harris. ",
                "The pair then run into slave catchers, as George Harris shoots Tom Loker and wounds him. However, the group decide to save Tom Loker and nurse him back to health. Tom Loker becomes reformed and quits his job as a slave catcher later into the story. A tip from Tom Loker allows George and Eliza Harris to escape safely into Canada. Eventually, as a story between George and Eliza Harris and Uncle Tom converges, Madame de Thoux and Cassy realize that they have blood relations to George and Eliza. The quintet reconvenes and all is happy."

As Haley and company are moving down South, uncle Tom runs into Eva St. Clare. He talks to the girl, and they form a relationship. Eventually, Eva falls into the River, and uncle Tom bravely dives in to save Eva while everyone else watches. Augustine St. Clare, Eva's father, eventually rotisme agreement with Mr. Haley to purchase uncle Tom.",
                "As they move down to Augustine's house, two new characters are introduced: Marie St. Clare and Miss Ophelia. Miss Ophelia is the cousin of Augustine from the South, and a very prudent woman, while Marie is the wife of Augustine and the antithesis to Miss Ophelia's ideals. The story then follows the daily commotion of the St. Clare household, as uncle Tom's relation with Eva grows stronger. Topsy, a troublemaking black girl, is also introduced, given to Ophelia by Augustine as a pet project. The unconditional love of Eva inspires many here. Eventually, Eva begins to perish from a sickness, casting a gloomy shadow on the rest of the household that leads into the death of Augustine from a wound in a bar fight. The slaves are distressed, as Augustine had promised some of them freedom, an order that Marie is too lazy to carry out.",
                "Uncle Tom is eventually sold to Simon Legree, an extremely negligent slave owner, along with Emmeline. There, Simon attempts to make Uncle Tom an evil overseer of the plantation, in line with Sambo and Quimbo; however, uncle Tom sticks to his morals and does not relent. A sighting of Jesus Christ further reaffirms his beliefs, as he points out on how Legree cannot harm his soul, but only his physical body. Cassy, an African American woman that assists uncle Tom, is also introduced. Eventually, uncle Tom is beaten to death, but not before spreading scripture to many on the plantation. Cassy and Emmeline make their escape from the plantation, utilizing the garret of the house and pretending to be ghosts haunting the residence. Eventually, George Harris finds Uncle Tom on his deathbed, curses Legree, and vows to never enslave anyone again while setting his slaves free. Cassy runs into George Harris on a steamboat, and they collectively realize that she is the mother of Eliza Harris and Madame De Thoux (someone they met on the steamboat) is the sister of George Harris."

            "paragraphs": [
                "One of the most poignant arguments against slavery that Harriet Beecher Stowe makes in the novel is the importance of family. The splitting of families is constantly emphasized, with Eliza and George Harris being an obvious example, but also many other characters like mammy, Emmeline, Cassy, etc. are affected. Cassy is seen to be sardonic because of her separation from her children and sister, and becomes a different person entirely when she becomes reunited with her sister, Eliza, showing the effect that family can have.",
                "In addition to being a point of argument, family is also used heavily in conjunction with christian memory to reinforce antislavery sentiments within the novel. Christian ideals of family are brought up through examples in scripture, contrasting with the actual conditions of slaves."

                "The unconditional love of Eva St. Clare shapes many throughout the novel, and comes as one of the novel's greatest thematic beats. Eva does not see race as a factor in who she loves; to Eva, everyone is deserving, which greatly touches many characters while sending a strong message to the reader, beyond antislavery sentiments. The book shows how love towards another human, especially when he or she has not experienced a great deal of admiration, can change their personality and attitude greatly, as a teaching tool (in the case of topsy) or as a method for reform (in the case of Tom Loker).",
                "For clarification, it is also not just Eva who exhibits unconditional love in the novel; most morally correct characters show varying degrees of love towards others that have profound effects, like Uncle Tom towards Sambo and Quimbo, or Uncle Tom towards Eva when he rescues her from the river. The power of love and affection towards others to combat evil is ever present throughout the novel."

This is done as a literary device, but also as a way to convince the reader of the evils of slavery; Stowe understood that the majority of her audience would be religious, and thus catered to them when writing the novel by including explicit references to Christianity and scripture. Two of the most important characters in the novel--Uncle Tom and Ava--both are heavily christian; Uncle Tom even draws greatly from the story of Jesus Christ."

                        "The poem consists of three <bold>stanzas</bold>, each revolving around the central idea of fighting for freedom (two are quintains, while one has 12 lines). Most lines have <bold>enjambment</bold>, and run over into other lines, creating an odd <bold>meter</bold> throughout the poem, giving the poem a natural feel as opposed to the strict meters and rhyme schemes of an iambic pentameter. <bold>Simile</bold> is used to great effect, most notably combining the idea of freedom into the growing of a seed in the last stanza. It could be said that the poem contains <bold>caesuras</bold>, with the odd line breaks often making new lines with 1 or two words, that the reader can interpret more as a pause in delivery instead of the start of a new line. It should be noted that caesuras normally are marked with punctuation. The poem also has examples of <bold>dactyl</bold>, which is a foot containing a stressed syllable followed by two unstressed syllables. Notably, on \"I can-not live on to-mor-row's bread\", and \"On my two feet\", and \"And own the land.\"",
                        "The poem, written by Langston Hughes, draws obvious parallels between its themes and Uncle Tom's Cabin. Langston Hughes was a pioneer of the Harlem Renaissance, which was a movement that highlighted music, films, and other art made by African Americans, originating in Harlem, New York City. The poem itself speaks of fighting for freedom instead of waiting for freedom to come by, which resonates with the philosophy of George Harris, who opted to run and fight instead of waiting for his demise. The poem also highlights a great desire for freedom, which is obviously consistent with the rhetoric of most slaves at the time."
